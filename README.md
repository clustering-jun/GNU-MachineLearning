### Course Objectives
This course aims to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental concepts and techniques of machine learning. Through lectures and practical exercises using Python, students will learn how to explore, preprocess, and analyze data, as well as apply various supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. The course emphasizes both theoretical understanding and hands-on implementation, enabling students to build, evaluate, and improve predictive models. By the end of the course, students will be able to apply machine learning methods to real-world problems and develop a critical perspective on model performance and limitations.
